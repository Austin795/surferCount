# Surf crowd  

### Project Goal
Allow users to see near real-time count of people at a particular popular surf break

People want to surf good conditions but its often crowded when its good. Help them find times when its quieter to go.

Leverage pre-existing global surf webcams run by Surfline, Magic Seaweed, and others..

1. Access Surfline webcam web page
2. Take screenshot of surf camera view
3. Run screenshot through "model" to pick out surfers within surf
4. Clean up model results and give number found
5. Report number of surfers alongside surf conditions
6. Notify users in some way when surf conditions are good and crowd size is small
